## Applications

I use a lot of applications on my mac. Below is a list of the ones that I love and use the most in my day to day life.

I also share [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles#readme) together with my [iOS setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios#readme). And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/macOSautomation) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

### Productivity

#### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - Launcher

- Alfred is a powerful launcher that you can program to show anything you want. It saved me a lot of time in my life.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5h1BMVO.png" width="700" alt="img">

- It has a great [community](http://www.alfredforum.com/) and [amazing workflows](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#readme) that you can use.

- I wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432) on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library.

#### [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - Keyboard remapping

- Karabiner is an absolutely amazing app that lets you remap keys at a very low level on macOS.
- I have completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.
- For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a [hyper key](http://brettterpstra.com/2017/06/15/a-hyper-key-with-karabiner-elements-full-instructions/). Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example, for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it, it becomes `⌘ + ⌃` modifier key. So `Caps Lock + F` becomes `⌘ + ⌃ + F`. And so on.
- I take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys for **every single key on my keyboard**.
- I describe how I use Karabiner in detail [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/karabiner/karabiner) and I generate [my configuration](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/karabiner/karabiner.edn) with a [Karabiner DSL](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo#readme).

#### [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Automation tool

- Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.
- It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.
- I share [all the macros I use](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) with the app.

#### [2Do](http://www.2doapp.com/mac) - Flexible task manager

- I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me [organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do). Here is how my sidebar looks:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Rnxd5ti.png" width="150">

- It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/b9lGFs0.png" width="400" alt="img">

#### [Trello](https://trello.com) - Project management tool

- I use the app a lot to track various projects I have in my life.
- I share many boards I made [publicly](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello). Here is an example of a public board for tracking various [things I want to learn](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).

![](https://i.imgur.com/oDw8Gb0.jpg)

- I assign myself to the cards I am working on now and filter to see only them by [pressing Q key](https://trello.com/shortcuts). I mark cards I want to work on next with `Next` tag.

#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager

- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.
- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.

#### [Timing](https://timingapp.com/?) - Automatic time tracker

- I use Timing app to fully automate tracking my time on my computer.
- The fact that I can combine active and passive tracking together is very powerful and allows me to be more aware of where I spend my time.

![](https://i.imgur.com/KE7Fk35.png)

#### [MindNode](https://mindnode.com) - Interactive Mind Mapping

- An application which allowed me to originally create all of the maps for [Learn Anything](https://learn-anything.xyz).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/learn-anything/learn-anything/2017/media/header.png)

- I also use MindNode to visualize topics and their relations as an [interactive mind map](https://my.mindnode.com/dPmKpWZgTpZsaG4Rf1yaz7rXbYhnuqPDDpdss4w2#1594.8,-1084.6,1).

![](https://i.imgur.com/uzNNYiz.png)

#### [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) - Text expansions

- I use the app to [fully automate writing repetitive text](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).
- I share all the Typinator sets I made with the app [here](typinator).

#### [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) - Mac input customizer

- I use this app a lot for mapping [various trackpad gestures](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze) to hotkeys and actions both globally and per specific apps.
- I love scrolling through my tabs in Safari with three finger swipes left and right as well as opening and closing tabs with swiping up and down respectively.
- I share [all the different gestures I have setup to use with the app](btt#readme) that you can view and download.
- I also use the app to modify how my TouchBar looks.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BqBGuXq.png)

#### [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/) - PDF reader/editor

- I read a lot of PDFs like books, research papers and the like. This app is a huge upgrade over Preview app that I used before.
- Multiple tabs, sepia mode, very nice annotation tools, great search, performance.

#### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Calendar

- I use the app to manage events in my life.
- I take great use of Fantastical's natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.
- I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days only with all 24h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do now. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives me the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.

#### [Contexts](https://contexts.co) - Window switcher

- Allows me to fuzzy search through all the currently active windows that I have.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZiRGtFc.png)

- Makes jumping to the right window I need effortless. I often may have many VS Code instances with different projects running and this lets me switch to the project I need in seconds.

#### [TaskPaper](https://www.taskpaper.com) - Plain text TODOs

- Use the app to [dissect problems I am trying to solve into smaller and smaller parts I can work on](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/research/solving-problems).

![](https://i.imgur.com/2pGHIOu.png)

#### [Dictionary](<http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Dictionary_(software)>)

- Comes natively with macOS and I started to love using it for exploring and searching through Wikipedia.
- It is incredibly fast to make the searches and it gives quick autosuggestions for any query I type that I can then select with up and down arrows.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Nj4erv5.png)

#### [Bartender](https://www.macbartender.com/) - Menu bar organizer

- Allows you to customize and hide the contents of your menu bar and improve the aesthetics of your OS. Here is how mine looks:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ER32snR.png" width="500" alt="img">

- My menu bar is always hidden so I rarely ever use it and I show most needed info on the [TouchBar](btt#readme) instead.

#### [Focus](https://heyfocus.com) - Block distracting websites

- I use [Focus app](https://heyfocus.com) as a recurring [pomodoro timer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) which lets me work in sessions of 80 minutes with 10 min breaks by blocking [distracting websites](https://gist.github.com/nikitavoloboev/57340528a6dfb3eb498dce647ed6841f) and apps.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/H7TMqgS.png" width="500" alt="img">

#### [Annotate](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/annotate-capture-screenshot/id918207447?mt=12) - Create and annotate screenshots

- Best annotation tool I found to exist. After you make a screenshot, it allows for quick edits. Adding arrows, some text, blurring parts of the image as well as ability to quickly save the image or drag it to Dropzone to upload to Imgur to share the link quickly with anyone I want.

#### [Popclip](https://pilotmoon.com/popclip/) - iOS like mouse text selection popover

- Another great utility I cannot live without, brings up a quick menu whenever some text is selected on which I can do a number of quick actions, like searching on Google, DuckDuckGo, YouTube, Dictionary, Reddit, Google Images or it can translate text selected, copy it or even make a SnippetsLab snippet from it. Here is how it looks for me:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/R6ksJi3.png" width="400" alt="img">

- I share all the extensions I use with it [here](popclip#readme.md).

#### [Noizio](http://noiz.io/) - Ambient sounds

#### [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org) - Automation tool

- Powerful automation engine I am still exploring. My config for it can be seen [here](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/hammerspoon/).

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/5InxMrE.png" width="300" alt="img">

#### [Little Snitch](https://www.obdev.at/products/littlesnitch/index.html) - Control incoming/outgoing network traffic

- Amazing networking tool that gives you a clear picture of what connections are incoming to your computer and what are outgoing.
- Takes a bit of time to set it up correctly and is quite an insightful experience first turning it on and having it notify every couple of seconds that some app is trying to send data to some server and whether you want to allow that.
- This is essential if you want to take control of what information gets sent out from your computer and what connections have the right to connect to your data.

- Enhance play/pause as well as previous/next playback keys to not only work in iTunes and Spotify but work for SoundCloud, YouTube and many other services.

- Use this editor in addition to VS Code and Neovim for its blazing fast speed of opening files.

#### [SnippetsLab](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/) - Snippet manager

- I use the app to manage my own personal library of snippets. I prefix all snippets I make. For example vim snippets are prefixed with `vim:`. Git related snippets with `git:` and so on.
- This lets me then use the [Alfred workflow](https://www.renfei.org/snippets-lab/press-release/whats-new/osx-1.6) that the app's author provides to search for these snippets insanely fast.

![](https://i.imgur.com/QCrbftT.png)

Here is how my library looks:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/CMBW8Qf.png" width="500" alt="img">

#### [Telegram](https://desktop.telegram.org/) - Messenger

- The app has a very clean interface, a native client for macOS and stickers. Chats are not encrypted by default and don't use [approved cryptography](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/49782/is-telegram-secure) but the client is amazing and fast.

- Tweetbot is also blocked for me during my [Focus time](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/focusing/focusing). I can only post tweets but I can't visit the app to see my feeds.
- Twitter is my primary way to stay up to date on things and is my favorite social network after GitHub. I curate and publicly share all [Twitter lists](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists) I personally use.
- I have Tweetbot open in full screen with three columns (Mentions/[Top](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/top)/[Software](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev/lists/softeare)). Here is how that looks for me:

![](https://i.imgur.com/OO7hz6i.png)

#### [Sblack](https://www.sblack.online/) - Slack client (native)

- Use it to replace the official bloated mess that Slack app is. Love its dark mode feature, fast startup time and lower RAM usage.

### Writing

#### [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com/) - Digital journal

- Day One is my digital life journal.
- My entire life's experiences lives encrypted in the journal. Adding photographs I made, the thoughts I had and events that happened to me.
- I document and review [my life](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/looking-back/looking-back) publicly too.
- The app has integration with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/day_one) which I use to automatically log all [my tweets](https://twitter.com/nikitavoloboev) and [Instagram posts](https://instagram.com/nikitavoloboev).
- If you don't journal, I suggest you to start, it is a very powerful mind cleanser and acts as a wonderful history record of your life.

#### [Ulysses](http://www.ulyssesapp.com/) - Writing app

- The app I use to write all my [Medium](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev) articles in.
- All your writing in one place is the motto and the underlying design of the app. I hook up my [wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) as an external folder and I love how it creates an index of everything that I can search over:

<img src="http://i.imgur.com/Aa17RCQ.png" width="500" alt="img">

- It also has pretty awesome export functions that let you export the text you write to PDF, ePub and HTML. I mostly use it's ability to export text to Medium.
- I use [Monokai Night](https://styles.ulyssesapp.com/bundle/Monokai+Night/5bbcb619b3dafa6b4e6d6bd4) theme when I write. Here is how it looks:

![](https://i.imgur.com/5yfxluP.png)

- I describe my thoughts and approach to writing [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/writing/writing).

#### [Marked](http://marked2app.com) - Preview rendered markdown files

- If I ever need to preview a readme or any other markdown file that I wrote or just want to read, this app is the best application for that I found. It also features live updating and quite a lot of customizable features.

### Design

#### [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) - Design tool

- Use the app to quickly prototype new designs. I also enjoy using [Figma](https://www.figma.com) a lot.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/ZSiZ5QA.png" width="400" alt="img">

### Video

#### [IINA](https://github.com/lhc70000/iina) - Video player

- Open source alternative to VLC built specifically for macOS.
- It is based on [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv) and has a more modern and native look than VLC.

#### [DaisyDisk](https://daisydiskapp.com) - Visualize taken disk space

- A great tool to quickly get a visual glance over what is taking up your disk space and where.

#### [iStat Menus](https://bjango.com/mac/istatmenus/) - Mac system monitoring from menu bar

- Great system monitoring tools which I use to quickly see my CPU/network/memory usage. I find it very valuable to know if my CPU is being abused by some application and if so by which. I then use [ProcessControl](https://github.com/vitorgalvao/alfred-workflows/tree/master/ProcessControl#readme) workflow to quickly kill off misbehaving processes. Often times iStat Menus is deactivated for me to preserve battery.

#### [PodcastMenu](https://github.com/insidegui/PodcastMenu) - Puts Overcast in menu bar

- Allows you to listen and control playback of podcasts from [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) right from your menu bar.

### Browsers

#### [Safari](https://www.apple.com/lae/safari/)

- My favorite browser. It is incredibly fast, doesn't have the baggage of all the Google Chrome tracking and is native to macOS so it is extremely optimized and doesn't kill your battery.
- One powerful plus that Chrome does have over safari is the amount of Chrome extensions that you can get. Fortunately the ones most needed for me do [exist on Safari](https://github.com/learn-anything/safari-extensions#readme).

##### Safari Extensions

- [sVim](https://github.com/flipxfx/sVim) - Adds a custom layer of keybinds you can customize to personalize your browsing experience. [My config](https://gist.github.com/c26e6a05e4e426e0542e55b7513b581c).
- [Wipr](https://itunes.apple.com/nl/app/wipr/id1320666476?l=en&mt=12) - Ad content blocker that uses [Safari native content blocking API's](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Extensions/Conceptual/ContentBlockingRules/Introduction/Introduction.html).
- [1Password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword/extensions) - [1Password](https://1password.com) is a phenomenal password manager, this extension just gives a seamless interaction of it with the browser.
- [Cascadea](https://cascadea.app) - Custom styles extension. Use it to create dark themes for apps that don't have a dark mode option. Also allows importing of [Stylish themes](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/web/browsers/stylish-themes).
- [Dark Reader](https://darkreader.org/safari/) - On websites that don't have a nice Stylish theme, I like to use Dark Reader to turn all the websites I visit to dark mode. It works surprisingly well.

#### [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

- I only use Chrome for web development due to its superior Chrome Dev tools.
