## Applications

I use a lot of apps on my mac. Below is a list of my favorite tools with descriptions of how I use them.

I also share [my dotfiles](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles) together with my [iOS setup](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-ios). And I made a [Telegram group](https://t.me/joinchat/BBKnQU4_rty6_942PFbPbw) to discuss all things macOS/iOS.

### Productivity

#### [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com) - Launcher

- Alfred is a powerful launcher that you can program to show anything you want. It save me a lot of time as I use it to search through anything instantly.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/MdIcKlh.png" width="700" alt="img">

- It has a great [community](https://www.alfredforum.com/) and [amazing workflows](https://github.com/learn-anything/alfred-workflows#readme) that you can use.

- I wrote [an article](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/writing-alfred-workflows-in-go-2a44f62dc432) on how anyone can start developing workflows of their own using Go language and [AwGo](https://github.com/deanishe/awgo) library.

#### [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) - Keyboard remapping

- Karabiner is life changing tool that [lets you remap keys at a very low level on macOS](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6).
- I completely remapped my keyboard with it and every key on my keyboard is a custom modifier key that I can program to do what I want.
- For example you can make caps lock into an escape key when pressed once but if you hold it, it becomes a [hyper key](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/karabiner-god-mode-7407a5ddc8f6). Hyper key means that a key now serves two purposes, once when pressed alone and once when held down. So for example, for remapping caps lock, we can remap it to act as escape when pressed alone once but if we hold down on it, it becomes `⌘ + ⌃` modifier key. So `Caps Lock + F` becomes `⌘ + ⌃ + F`. And so on.
- I take this idea further and define these kind of hyper keys for **every single key on my keyboard**.
- I describe how I use Karabiner in detail [here](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macos/macos-apps/karabiner) and I generate [my configuration](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/dotfiles/blob/master/karabiner/karabiner.edn) with a [Karabiner DSL](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo#readme).

#### [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/) - Automation tool

- Keyboard Maestro is essentially an IDE for automation. You create macros of actions that you can then easily call from Karabiner.
- It has a [wonderful community](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/) that is happy to help with whatever you are trying to achieve.
- I share [all the macros I use](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/keyboard-maestro/km-macros) with the app.

#### [2Do](https://www.2doapp.com/mac) - Flexible task manager

- I love GTD methodology. This app is phenomenal with helping me [organize my tasks](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/macOS/apps/2do). Here is how my sidebar looks:

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/I68CbYo.png" width="150">

- It also has global quick add with a hotkey. Together with lists, priorities, powerful search and a lot more.

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/QuBsexM.png" width="400" alt="img">

#### [Trello](https://trello.com) - Project management tool

- I use the app a lot to track various projects I have in my life.
- I share many boards I made [publicly](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/sharing/my-trello). Here is an example of a public board for tracking various [things I want to learn](https://trello.com/b/cu32qF3q).

![](https://i.imgur.com/U0KSBJT.png)

- I assign myself to the cards I am working on now and filter to see only them by [pressing Q key](https://trello.com/shortcuts). I mark cards I want to work on next with `Next` tag.

#### [1Password](https://1password.com) - Password manager

- Generate all of my passwords with it and keep everything in a secured and encrypted vault kept secure by my one master password.
- No longer need to remember passwords and I now have a unique password for every website that I am signed up on whilst [activating two factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) wherever possible.

#### [Typinator](http://www.ergonis.com/products/typinator/) - Text expansions

- I use the app to [fully automate writing repetitive text](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/write-once-never-write-again-c2fa1f6c4e8).
- I share all the Typinator sets I made with the app [here](typinator).

#### [BetterTouchTool](https://www.boastr.net/) - Mac input customizer

- I use this app a lot for mapping [various trackpad gestures](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/take-control-of-your-touchpad-on-macos-45c581f542e0#.7n1ye6vze) to hotkeys and actions both globally and per specific apps.
- I love scrolling through my tabs in Safari with three finger swipes left and right as well as opening and closing tabs with swiping up and down respectively.
- I share [all the different gestures I have setup to use with the app](btt#readme) that you can view and download.
- I also use the app to modify how my TouchBar looks.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Ubna3yL.png)

#### [PDF Expert](https://pdfexpert.com/) - PDF reader/editor

- I read a lot of PDFs like books, research papers and the like. This app is a huge upgrade over Preview app that I used before.
- Multiple tabs, sepia mode, very nice annotation tools, great search, performance.

#### [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical) - Calendar

- I use the app to manage events in my life.
- I take great use of Fantastical's natural language input and I use [many Typinator expansions](https://medium.com/@nikitavoloboev/fantastical-natural-input-text-expansions-3ea8cf7ccac3#.pv5937ncr) to ease this process.
- I always view my events from `Week` view. And show 5 days with 16h shown for all days. This lets me have a perspective over what I have to do now. What deadlines I have to complete soon. And gives me the freedom to adjust my schedule in light of upcoming deadlines and events.

#### [Contexts](https://contexts.co) - Window switcher

- Allows me to fuzzy search through all the currently active windows that I have.

![](https://i.imgur.com/VdNRlGM.png)

#### [Dictionary](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_(software)>)

- It is incredibly fast to make the searches and it gives quick autosuggestions for any query I type that I can then select with up and down arrows.
